# Updated Project Proposal: Dual-LLM Text Analysis System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient text analysis system leveraging two local Language Models (LLMs) using our established Jupyter notebook-based methodology. The system will use a general-purpose LLM for initial text analysis and a specialized cybersecurity-focused LLM for final decision-making on data redaction. We will build upon our existing infrastructure, particularly our Ollama setup, to create a comprehensive, modular, and educational framework for deploying and managing multiple LLMs.

## Current Progress

We have successfully completed the following foundational steps:

1. Environment Setup (00_Environment_Setup.ipynb)
   - Conda environment configuration
   - Installation of necessary packages

2. Database Setup (01_Database_Setup.ipynb)
   - PostgreSQL and Neo4j configuration
   - Docker container setup for databases

3. Ollama Setup (02_Ollama_Setup.ipynb)
   - Configuration of Ollama for local LLM deployment
   - Creation of OllamaManager class for LLM management

## Next Steps and Implementation Plan

### 1. General-Purpose LLM Implementation (03_General_LLM_Implementation.ipynb)

- Select an appropriate general-purpose model compatible with Ollama (e.g., GPT-2, LLaMA)
- Implement the GeneralLLM class using our OllamaManager
- Develop functions for text analysis
- Demonstrate basic text analysis capabilities

### 2. Cybersecurity LLM Implementation (04_Cybersecurity_LLM_Implementation.ipynb)

- Research and select a cybersecurity-focused model compatible with Ollama
- Implement the CybersecurityLLM class using our OllamaManager
- Develop functions for security-related decision making
- Demonstrate basic security analysis capabilities

### 3. Model Optimization (05_Model_Optimization.ipynb)

- Implement quantization techniques for both LLMs
- Explore and implement model parallelism if necessary
- Optimize VRAM usage to ensure both models can run concurrently
- Benchmark and compare performance before and after optimization

### 4. Fine-Tuning Process (06_Fine_Tuning.ipynb)

- Set up datasets for fine-tuning (e.g., SQuAD, custom cybersecurity datasets)
- Implement fine-tuning process for both LLMs
- Demonstrate the fine-tuning process and evaluate improvements

### 5. API Development (07_API_Development.ipynb)

- Develop a Flask API that integrates both LLMs
- Implement endpoints for text analysis and security decision-making
- Demonstrate API usage and testing

### 6. Docker Deployment (08_Docker_Deployment.ipynb)

- Update our Docker setup to include both LLM services
- Configure Docker Compose for multi-container deployment
- Demonstrate deployment and testing of the complete system

### 7. Performance Monitoring and Logging (09_Monitoring_and_Logging.ipynb)

- Implement resource monitoring (CPU, GPU, memory usage)
- Set up logging for model performance and system operations
- Demonstrate monitoring and log analysis

## Implementation Details

- Each notebook will follow our established methodology of explaining concepts, showing code modifications, and demonstrating how changes affect the overall system.
- We will continue to use the OllamaManager class, extending its functionality as needed for managing multiple models.
- The project will maintain a focus on modular design, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle and other best practices.
- Each notebook will include unit tests and comprehensive documentation.

## Challenges and Considerations

1. Model Selection: Careful consideration needed to find suitable Ollama-compatible models for both general-purpose and cybersecurity tasks.
2. Resource Management: Optimizing two LLMs to run concurrently on a single machine will require careful resource management and optimization.
3. API Integration: Integrating the Flask API within our Jupyter notebook environment may require additional tools or techniques.
4. Docker Complexity: Managing multiple LLM services in Docker will increase the complexity of our deployment process.

## Learning Objectives

- Advanced LLM deployment and management
- Model optimization techniques (quantization, parallelism)
- Multi-model system architecture
- API development for ML services
- Advanced Docker usage for ML projects

## Conclusion

This updated project plan builds upon our existing work with Ollama and extends it to create a more complex, multi-model system. By following this plan, we will create a comprehensive, educational framework for deploying and managing multiple LLMs, while maintaining our focus on clear explanations and step-by-step development. This project will provide valuable experience in creating advanced NLP systems and prepare us for more complex machine learning deployments in the future.
