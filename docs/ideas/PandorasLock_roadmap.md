# 6-Month Roadmap: RAG Tools Project

## Month 1: CLI Implementation and Refinement

### Week 1-2: CLI Development

- Review and refine the existing CLI implementation in 03_CLI_Implementation.ipynb
- Implement additional CLI commands for managing Ollama models and configurations
- Add error handling and input validation to the CLI

### Week 3-4: CLI Testing and Documentation

- Conduct thorough testing of all CLI commands
- Create user documentation for the CLI tool
- Implement unit tests for CLI functionality

## Month 2: Advanced LLM Configurables

### Week 1-2: LLM Parameter Integration

- Implement adjustable parameters for the LLM (context length, temperature, etc.)
- Update OllamaManager to handle these new parameters
- Extend CLI to allow real-time adjustment of LLM parameters

### Week 3-4: Chat Interface Enhancement

- Implement conversation history management
- Add support for multi-turn conversations in the CLI
- Develop a method to save and load conversation sessions

## Month 3: RAG System Core Development

### Week 1-2: Document Ingestion and Preprocessing

- Develop a system for ingesting various document types (PDF, TXT, etc.)
- Implement text extraction and cleaning procedures
- Create a chunking strategy for large documents

### Week 3-4: Vector Database Integration

- Integrate pgvector more deeply into the RAG system
- Implement efficient vector storage and retrieval methods
- Develop a query system for finding relevant document chunks

## Month 4: Knowledge Graph Integration

### Week 1-2: Neo4j Integration

- Develop a system for converting document information into a knowledge graph
- Implement methods for storing and updating the graph in Neo4j
- Create query methods for retrieving information from the graph

### Week 3-4: Combined Vector and Graph Querying

- Develop a hybrid query system that utilizes both vector similarity and graph relationships
- Implement a ranking system for query results
- Integrate this query system with the LLM for enhanced responses

## Month 5: Advanced RAG Features

### Week 1-2: Context Window Management

- Implement dynamic context window adjustment based on query complexity
- Develop a system for efficiently combining retrieved information with the user query
- Implement a method for handling queries that exceed the context window

### Week 3-4: Multi-Model Support

- Extend the system to support multiple LLMs (e.g., different sizes or specialties)
- Implement a model selection system based on query type or user preference
- Update the CLI to support model switching and comparison

## Month 6: Performance Optimization and Final Integration

### Week 1-2: Performance Benchmarking and Optimization

- Conduct thorough performance testing of the entire RAG system
- Identify and optimize bottlenecks in query processing and LLM interaction
- Implement caching mechanisms for frequent queries or responses

### Week 3-4: Final Integration and Documentation

- Ensure all components of the RAG system are fully integrated and working seamlessly
- Conduct end-to-end testing of the entire system
- Create comprehensive documentation for the entire project
- Prepare a final demo or presentation of the RAG Tools system
